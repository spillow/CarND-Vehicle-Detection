**Vehicle Detection Project**

The goals / steps of this project are the following:

* Perform a Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) feature extraction on a labeled training set of images and train a classifier Linear SVM classifier
* Additionally, a color transform and binned color features, as well as histograms of color, were added to the HOG features to boost classifier accuracy.
* Note: for those first two steps don't forget to normalize your features and randomize a selection for training and testing.
* Implement a sliding-window technique and use your trained classifier to search for vehicles in images.
* Run your pipeline on a video stream (start with the test_video.mp4 and later implement on full project_video.mp4) and create a heat map of recurring detections frame by frame to reject outliers and follow detected vehicles.
* Estimate a bounding box for vehicles detected.

## [Rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/513/view) Points

---

#### 1. Provide a Writeup / README that includes all the rubric points and how you addressed each one.  You can submit your writeup as markdown or pdf.  [Here](https://github.com/spillow/CarND-Vehicle-Detection/blob/master/writeup_template.md) is a template writeup for this project you can use as a guide and a starting point.

You're reading it!

### Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG)

#### 1. Explain how (and identify where in your code) you extracted HOG features from the training images.

The code for this step is contained in lines # through # of the file called `car_pipeline.py` in the function `get_hot_features()`.  TODO!!!

I started by reading in all the `vehicle` and `non-vehicle` images.  Here is an example of one of each of the `vehicle` and `non-vehicle` classes:

I then explored different color spaces and different `skimage.hog()` parameters (`orientations`, `pixels_per_cell`, and `cells_per_block`).  The starting values of `orientations = 9`, `pixels_per_cell = 8`, and `cells_per_block = 2` was ultimately modified to `orientations = 11`, `pixels_per_cell = 16`, and `cells_per_block = 2`. I grabbed random images from each of the two classes and displayed them to get a feel for what the `skimage.hog()` output looks like.

Here is an example using the `YCrCb` color space and HOG parameters of `orientations=9`, `pixels_per_cell=(16, 16)` and `cells_per_block=(2, 2)`:

#### 2. Explain how you settled on your final choice of HOG parameters.

While the initial and final setting of values both yielded classifiers of roughly 99% test accuracy, the latter numbers yieled a 33% performance improvement which was a big win with the slow processing times of this project.

#### 3. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you trained a classifier using your selected HOG features, color features, and spatial features.

I trained a linear SVM using sklearn in the function `train_classifier()` on line TODO!!!.  I used a GridSearch approach as
the best `C` parameter to control the complexity of the svm decision boundary was not obvious.  Before this point, the HOG, color, and spatial features were extracted from each of the training images, combined into one long feature vector in `extract_features()` on line TODO!!!, and normalized.

### Sliding Window Search

#### 1. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you implemented a sliding window search.  How did you decide what scales to search and how much to overlap windows?

I implemented a sliding window search in `slide_window()` on line TODO!!!. Given a region, window size, and amount of overlap, the function emits a list of windows.

Scales were initially selected such that they would roughly match the sizes of the cars of interest.  I noted that, due to the fact that the training data only had cars with minimal offset from being centered, the training windows needed to be fairly well targeted to the car.  Another set of windows targeted to the road horizon was added with 0.97 overlap to capture cars that I was having difficulty detecting with only the two sets of window sizes (32x32 and 64x64, respectively).

#### 2. Show some examples of test images to demonstrate how your pipeline is working.  What did you do to optimize the performance of your classifier?

Ultimately I searched on two scales using YCrCb 3-channel HOG features plus spatially binned color and histograms of color in the feature vector, which provided a nice result.  Here are some example images:

### Video Implementation

#### 1. Provide a link to your final video output.  Your pipeline should perform reasonably well on the entire project video (somewhat wobbly or unstable bounding boxes are ok as long as you are identifying the vehicles most of the time with minimal false positives.)
Here's a [link to my video result](https://github.com/spillow/CarND-Vehicle-Detection/blob/master/output.mp4)

#### 2. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you implemented some kind of filter for false positives and some method for combining overlapping bounding boxes.

I recorded the positions of positive detections in each frame of the video.  From the positive detections I created a heatmap and then thresholded that map to identify vehicle positions.  I then used `scipy.ndimage.measurements.label()` to identify individual blobs in the heatmap.  I then assumed each blob corresponded to a vehicle.  I constructed bounding boxes to cover the area of each blob detected.

Here's an example result showing the heatmap from a series of frames of video, the result of `scipy.ndimage.measurements.label()` and the bounding boxes then overlaid on the last frame of video:

### Here are six frames and their corresponding heatmaps:

### Here is the output of `scipy.ndimage.measurements.label()` on the integrated heatmap from all six frames:

###Discussion

####1. Briefly discuss any problems / issues you faced in your implementation of this project.  Where will your pipeline likely fail?  What could you do to make it more robust?

Here I'll talk about the approach I took, what techniques I used, what worked and why, where the pipeline might fail and how I might improve it if I were going to pursue this project further.
